Implementation Notes:


*************
Creating trace files:
*************
You should create/modify trace files to help with testing your code. 
It may be helpful to add print commands (4 0 0) before and after places where your output is different.  
The format for trace files is described in the handout.


*************
Adding additional functions:
*************
Put the code for each of your functions in the file of the same name.  If you 
need/want auxilliary functions, you can do this easily one of two ways:
* add the function to the file for the function that uses it - this 
    works well if only one of your functions needs this
* add a new file to the library itself.  This is the recommended solution if 
     one of your main functions use the same auxillary function.  To do this:
     1.  Create a new file with the name of the function. 
     2.  In the Makefile, add an entry to compile the function to an object file 
         and add the new function to the 'ar' command (as well as the dependencies).
         You can use one of the basic functions (mm_free for example) as a pattern.
