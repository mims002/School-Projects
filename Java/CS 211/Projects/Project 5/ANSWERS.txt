PROBLEM 1: TESTING
==================

(10%) The correct implementation is #: (fill in your answer below
imp???

2,6,7,8
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

KNOWN FAULTY IMPLEMENTATIONS
----------------------------
(4%) Describe the general problems with imp11

 It failed the multiple mode in the same list for integers, doubles and String.
 It only returned the first one instead of all of them.

(4%) Describe the general problems with imp12

 It failed the multiple mode in the same list with negative integer.
 It only returned the first one instead of all of them.

(4%) Describe the general problems with imp13

 It failed the tests for the mode function with empty list.

PROBLEM 2: DEBUGGING
====================

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(55%) Include the command line you found to pass as many phases as
possible. Include your NetID at the beginning.  To complete all
phases, a total of 29 command line args including NetID are required.

(5%) Describe your experience using the debugger. What helped, what
frustrated, and what lessons will you take forward? Limit your
description to one to two paragraphs.

Using the debugger made things easy to pinpoint what each number I input was doing. I could also make changes to each variable 
while I was debugging it which helped speed up debugging process. One thing that frustrating was I couldn't go back while debugging, only forward. 
In the future I will be will use the debug tool to run my faulty code and change variables while running or watch how certain variables change to help 
find the problem with it.
